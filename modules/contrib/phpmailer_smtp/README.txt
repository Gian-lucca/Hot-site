* Using Google Mail or Google Apps as SMTP server

  To send e-mails with Google Mail use the following settings:

    SMTP server:     smtp.gmail.com
    SMTP port:       465
    Secure protocol: SSL
    Username:        your_google_mail_name@gmail.com
      or:            your_username@your_google_apps_domain.com
    Password:        your_google_mail_password

  In Advanced SMTP settings:
    Enable 'Always set "Reply-To" address' checkbox.

* Errors when trying to send a test email

  If you see the following error messages when trying to send a test email from
  the settings page:

    SMTP -> ERROR: Failed to connect to server: Connection timed out (110)
    SMTP Error: Could not connect to SMTP host. 

  it means the mail server can not be reached, usually because your hosting
  provider is blocking the port by a firewall. The solution is to ask your
  provider to allow outgoing connections to your mail server.

* Debug settings

  PHPMailer SMTP supports rerouting all e-mails for debugging purposes, to
  prevent you from accidentally sending out e-mails to real users from a
  development site.  To enable this feature, add the following lines to the end
  of your settings.php (usually located in sites/default):

    $conf['system.maintenance']['phpmailer_smtp_debug_email']
      = 'your_debug_email@yoursite.com';

  This will change the recipient of all e-mails to the configured address.
